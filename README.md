# Hardy-weinberg-theorem
A python file to experimentally confirm the Hardy-weinberg-theorem.
Studies the evolution of three groups in a population, in order to showcase how the proportion between them remains constant within the generational transition.
Instructions: 
- Enter number of generational transitions
- Enter number of individuals on the population (>100 in order to avoid errors)
- Enter proportion of AA group (carriers of two dominant traits, 0<=x<=1, maximum float 2 decimals)
- Enter proportion of Aa group (carriers of both dominant and recessive traits, 0<=x<=1, maximum float 2 decimals)
- Enter proportion of aa group (carriers of two recessive traits, 0<=x<=1, maximum float 2 decimals)
A graphic will be plotted following the choosen imputs.
